    <h1>2.The Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 would be a good choice if you are looking for a bike that offers outright thrills, meaty mid-range, stylish looks, and a powerful cruising machine. The GT's sporty riding position makes it much more suitable for twisty mountain roads and even high speed straight line blasts.</h1>
<h1>3.It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company. In 2017 it was revealed, inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine. The Interceptor 650 was unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which shares the same engine.</h1>
